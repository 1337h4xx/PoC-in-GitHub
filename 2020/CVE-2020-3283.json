The vulnerability is due to a communication error between internal functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL\/TLS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer underrun, which leads to a crash. The crash causes the affected device to reload.",
