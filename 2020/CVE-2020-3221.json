        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2020-3221 : A vulnerability in the Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet processor of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet to the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data port of an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a process crash that would cause a reload of the device.",
