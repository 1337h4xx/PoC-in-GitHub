        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-39201 : WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor\/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https:\/\/wordpress.org\/news\/category\/releases\/ https:\/\/hackerone.com\/reports\/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https:\/\/hackerone.com\/wordpress)",
