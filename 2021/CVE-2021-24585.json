Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https:\/\/wpscan.com\/reports\/submissions\/4699\/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id",
