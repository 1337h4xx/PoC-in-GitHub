        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-32778 : Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoyâ€™s procedure for resetting a HTTP\/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H\/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H\/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP\/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP\/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.",
