        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-21409 : Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP\/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj\/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.",
