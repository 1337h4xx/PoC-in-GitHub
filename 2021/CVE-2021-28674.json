        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-28674 : The node management page in SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.5 HF1 allows an attacker to create or delete a node (outside of the attacker's perimeter) via an account with write permissions. This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers) and the access control on Services\/NodeManagement.asmx\/DeleteObjNow is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and must have node management rights associated with at least one valid group on the platform.",
