        "description": "A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet in CVE project by @Sn0wAlice",
